                    Traffic Management refers to the combination of measures that serve to preserve traffic capacity and improve the
                    security, safety and reliability of the overall road transport system. These measures make use of ITS systems, services
                    and projects in day-to-day operations that impact on road network performance.</p>

                    <p class="text">Implementing sustainable mobility
                    Currently, traffic on local roads has reached such a level that it is necessary to address issues of sustainable
                    development and seek complex transport solutions for the city. The possibilities offered by construction of the new
                    transport infrastructure are limited and the trend in the development of motor transport requires application of
                    regulatory measures.
                    
                    Moreover, specific suitable alternatives and new opportunities must be developed. One objective of the city is aimed at
                    regulation and segregation of motor transport in order to avoid safety risks for the population and to limit emission of
                    harmful gases, noise and vibrations. It furthermore deals with priority for public transport (PT) and support of walking
                    and cycling modes and also promotion for quality and cleaner life in the city.</p>

    <h3 id="influence">THE INFLUENCE OF CERTAIN FACTORS ON THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES ON LAGOS ROADS</h3>
       <div class="col-lg-4 my-3 p-3 text-center">
        <h4>Influence of days of the week on casualties</h4>
        <img class="pad" src="./assets/images/friday.jpeg" height="300" width="300" alt="">
        <p class="para">Lagos State is a suitable case study because it hosts metropolitan Lagos,
        Nigeria’s major traffic center, fastest growing city, and most heavily
        motorized urban area in the country. Consequently, the state has one of the
        highest accident and casualty rates in the country.Research has shown that these casualties happen mostly on weekends,especially on <b>Fridays</b>.Accidents are most severe on Fridays because it is the last day of work and more people wants to
        go home to spend the weekend with their loved ones. The traffic
        situation in Lagos state is bad because of the absence of effective transport
        planning, vehicle-misuse, poor management, inadequate street parking,
        traffic congestion, delays and accidents among other contributory factors.If all these can be put in place,the casualty rate will reduce drastically</p>
      </div>
      
           <div class="col-lg-4 my-3 p-3 text-center">
        <h4>Influence of Area(Urban/rural) on casualties</h4>
        <img class="pad" src="./assets/images/urban.jpeg" height="300" width="300" alt="">
        <p class="para">Lagos, Nigeria continues to grow in population density and urbanization. The city currently stands as the one of the largest urban area in the world. Lagos urban area is home to approximately 33% of the Lagos State population.
        Urban development in Lagos without conservation strategies has the potential to increase the risk of casualties on the streets of Lagos.Majority of the people in the Urban areas are vehicle owners who careless about obeying traffic rules,this is a factor that causes casualities. On the other hand the rural area are not well oriented,carelessly dump refuse on the streets,this causes traffic and blockage of roads which could lead to accident.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="col-lg-4 my-3 p-3 text-center">
        <h4>Influence of human crossing control on casualties</h4>
        <img class="pad" src="./assets/images/trafic wardens.jpeg" height="300" width="300" alt="">
        <p class="para">The influence of pedestrian crossing human control on casualties are most severe where there are no authority
            within 50 metres to help people cross the road.Some teenagers and most older people needs human crossing
            control,in the absense of this,these younger and older ones might be hit by a vehicle ,leading to
            casualties.Human crossing control will reduce the rate of casualtiees on Lagos roads </p>
    </div>
      
           <div class="col-lg-4 my-3 p-3 text-center">
        <h3>Influence of Road type on casualties</h3>
        <img class="pad" src="./assets/images/road.jpeg" height="300" width="300" alt="">
        <p class="para">Road Traffic Accidents are a major cause of morbidity and mortality
        worldwide, but especially in low and middle-income countries. The World
        Health Organization estimates that more than 3000 people are killed every
        day in road traffic accidents globally, with at least 30,000 others injured or
        disabled. This adds up to over 1 million people killed and between 20-50
        million injured or crippled in road traffic crashes each year.As in other developing counties, road traffic accidents in Nigeria are one of the most serious problems in need of pragmatic solutions.The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) and the police should be very familiar with the temporal and spatial distribution of road traffic accidents within their area of jurisdiction.They should know and notify the government when the roads are getting bad.Lack of these constitutes a serious problem and impedes rapid improvement of the safety standards.A proper patrol of the metropolis at the times of very high occurrence will go a long way towards achieving the desired result of reducing the ugly incidence and it's fatality in Lagos state in particular and Nigeria in general.Accidents are most severe on single carriage way than one ways because there is more pressure and tendency for collition on single carriage way,there should be more routes to a particular destination</p>

        <h4>Influence of pedestrian crossing facilities on casualties</h4>
        <img class="pad" src="./assets/images/pedest.jpeg" height="300" width="300" alt="">
        <p class="para">Walking is a major mode of transportation in developing countries where most road users are pedestrians who spend significant time on roads and using the road system. Walking almost inevitably involves crossing a road, where the chances of conflict between pedestrian and motor vehicle is much higher.When a relatively unsafe choice is made, the pedestrian increases his accident risk and faces casualties.Pedestrians do not use road crossing facilities and 71% pedestrians prefer underpass rather than using foot over bridge.The reasons pedestrians are not using road crossing facilities are insufficient security, time consuming, poor entrance,hawker’s problem, discomfort, takes a long walk etc. To improve this situation several steps should be taken, such as:
        Enhance lighting facilities, prohibit commercial activities, adequate usage of roadside and median barrier, construct more underpass rather than foot over bridge etc.</p>

        <h4>Influence of a good traffic Management</h4>
        <img class="pad" src="./assets/images/pedes cro.jpeg" height="300" width="300" alt="">
        <p class="para">Traffic management can improve the flow of traffic on the roads, reducing emissions per vehicle kilometer traveled and enhancing urban mobility.Traffic management is arguably one of the most challenging problems that city administrators have to deal with in a large metropolis due to the increasingly large number of vehicles and the small changes that have occurred in terms of infrastructure over decades or centers in the oldest areas of the city.If all things can be put in place,there will be proper MANAGEMENT</p>
